# To Do List App with Node JS

url: https://todo-list-app-arya.herokuapp.com/

Just a small project from my course on Udemy that uses Node Js as the backend language and Mongo DB as the database.

You can use your own path like "/MyWorkByArya" and a new path will appear for your own to-do list.

Enjoy it ‚ù§
