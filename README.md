# To Do List App with Node JS

url: https://todo-list-app-arya.herokuapp.com/

Just a small project from my course on Udemy that use Node Js as backend language and Mongo DB as database.

You can use your own path like "/MyWorkByArya" and the new path will appear for your own to do list.

Enjoy it ‚ù§
